>an excellent article from the Guardian on hashing and salting</a>.</p><p>Having added that, we need 
to import the hash functions, plus another one that we're about to use, by adding this linejust after 
the imports from <code>flask_login</code>:</p><pre><code>from werkzeug.security import check_password_hash, 
generate_password_hash</code></pre><p>Now, let's specify a couple of users.  Normallya website would keep its list 
of users in the database -- and we'll change things to do that later -- but fornow, we'll just keep them in our code. 
Add this just after the <code>User</code> class:</p><pre><code>all_users = 
{    "admin": User("admin", generate_password_hash("secret")),   
"bob": User("bob", generate_password_hash("less-secret")),    
"caroline": User("caroline", generate_password_hash("completely-secret")),}
</code></pre><p>(Of course, having done all of that clever stuff so that we 
don't have the passwords in plaintext, we'renow adding code with... the passwords in plaintext.  
Don't worry -- that's going to change by the end of thistutorial!)</p><p>So that's a dictonary that maps from 
the username to the user object for three users.
